# Image Caption Joint Embedding

A multimodal embedding of images and captions, built with PyTorch, written with Python3.

## Introduction

Inspired by the paper: https://github.com/linxd5/VSE_Pytorch

## Getting started

Place your data in the `data/` folder. You must edit `data.py` to successfully import your data.

You can test the script using `f8k` dataset. Run `wget http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rkiros/datasets/f8k.zip` and extract the contents into the `data/` folder. 

Run `python3 train.py` to train your model.
